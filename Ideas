Suggestion from malvin: find bus stops with smallest number of buses, theres only 1 or little ways to pass thru

What if we use mrt train lines as subset? Smaller sample size 

Function to find route(stop no, bus to use, stop weight, stopid)
Route id:stopnostopnostopno + stopno
Loop through busses available in stop
Might not need stop no, can read from stupid
Add next stop by bus on id, read current stop using last 5 (?) digits 
Recall function until next stop= first 5(?) Digits

Ideal first stop is bus stop with 
1 bus
Next stop is interchange (?)

What if programming ends prematurely :thinking:
